Original Code Reference: [Few-Shot-Face-Translation](https://github.com/shaoanlu/fewshot-face-translation-GAN).

The original python notebook is able to swap face **from source image to target image** of your choice. In addtion, we have rewrote some parts in the code to suit purpose for our project, in which it can swap face **from source video to target video**. This is done by extract each frame from both videos and swap face frame by frame correspondingly.
